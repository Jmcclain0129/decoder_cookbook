# decoder_cookbook
my first mongo python flask project in pycharm

Development tasks and strategy
Decided to model this project after the mini project in the data centric module known as task_manager. I completed the task_manager mini project and committed it to Git. FOr this project I copies the files over from Git manually and removed the assets that would not be needed in the cookbook. I duplicated a few features in the add task features so that I could have sub categories which were not present in the original task manager project.
