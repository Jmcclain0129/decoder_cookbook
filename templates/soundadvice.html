    <h3>Sound Advice</h3>
    <p>This page is probably the most important one on this site. It's only advise though so do with it what you will. I think its valuable or I would not have taken the time to build the list.</p>

        <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">filter_drama</i><strong>First Words of Advice</strong></div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Be realistic with your expectations. Your journey as a coder begins here even if you have arrived here with previous experience like I have. I would strongly advise you to keep an open mind and not rely on what you think you know.<br><br>Push yourself, even though it is not going to be easy, to do the following...<br>
          <br> - Complete all of the lessons
          <br> - Sit through all of the video tutorials
          <br> - Build your projects instead of grabbing the source code provided along the way<br><br>
Finally, make sure you do as many of the challenges as possible. If you are on the 14 week bootcamp course these challenges do not impact your final grade, but if you fail to challenge yourself and complete them, your final grade mostly will reflect the fact you didn't bother doing them.</span></div>

        <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">place</i><strong>Setting up your workspaces</strong></div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>There are many environments you can work in and you'll learn pretty early on about Github as most of your projects will end up there. I don't recommend you rely on your local environment to develop your projects though. I recommend you immediately commit to github once you create the project. The course is requesting you use cloud9 which is provided through Amazon AWS. <br><br>I personally would recommend you experiment with a variety of workspaces and not just use Cloud9. In the 14 week period I have used 4 different ones including...<br><br> - Cloud9 (I did the HTML and CSS Courses with C9)<br> - VS Code (I did the first milestone javascript project with VSc)<br> - PyCharm (I did the second milestone flask/python project with PyCharm)<br> - Gitpod (I will use this to complete my 4th and final Milestone project featuring Django)<br><br>I personally struggled connecting each and everyone of the IDE's to Github, Heroku and MongoDB. There is quite a bit going on and your local machines settings can have adverse affects that add to your misery. This is why I strongly suggest you get your connections configured early on as it will reduce the time you spend debugging or refactoring your code as the projects progress.

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">whatshot</i><Strong>The Top Reasons for Committing Your Projects To Github as Early As Possible</Strong></div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>1. There is no reason not too! Seriously, why wouldn't you?<br><br>2. Your work is saved off in a safe space. A place you can access from anywhere and a place you can share with anyone.<br><br><strong> More Importantly:</strong> Github provides version control like know other. If you commit code often, which you should be doing, you can access a previous version in case you're not happy with that pot of spaghetti your local project has spawned into. Trust me when I say it is a lot quicker to revert to good code than it is trying to figure out how you ended up where you're at sometimes. If you spend more than five minutes trying to debug an issue that worked previously then stop, get the good code from Git and start over. This might be a good time to check in with a tutor as well, there's no shame in it that's what they are there for. They can save you a ton of time and aggravation. They are one of the greatest resources you'll have through this course... use them! <br><br>3. If you are speaking with tutors or your mentor they are going to want to see your code and this is how its done. Sure you can share your screen and such but for the sake of all concerned and most importantly father time, commit your code!<br><br><strong>Also Note...</strong> part of your milestone project grade depends on the frequency and quality of the commits your making. These are easy points to earn. A good practice would be to make a commit after you complete a milestone within your project. For example, once you create the project commit it, that's your projects first milestone really. Then when you add the navbar and footer, commit again. Commit each time you add new functionality and in the commit be sure to explain the milestone you accomplished so that your commit history reads like a task list of completed milestones within the project. As I said earlier, this is easy stuff that earns good points for the milestone projects which can compensate for lackluster development skills. Remember, everyone knows you're new at this that's why your in the course in the first place. This means the expectation isn't so much that you design a great looking site as much as you engage in all of the processes it takes to develop a project. Eventually you will become proficient at designing sites, but it is just as important to make sure you spend time developing a good build strategy to support your efforts. If you get good at that then your commits will follow right along with your documentation.</span></div>
